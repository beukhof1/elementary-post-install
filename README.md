## elementary-post-install script

forked this nice script from https://github.com/ramizdemiurge/elementary-post-install and removed the things i did not need and added some stuff and glitter.

Last tested on elementary OS 5.1.7 Hera (30-11-2020) on a Thinkpad X390 Yoga and a Xiaomi mi book 13 (i5 7200 model)

**please and thank you :+1: read the script first and remove what you dont need/want!**


**How to:**
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/beukhof1/elementary-post-install
cd elementary-post-install
chmod +x elementary-post-install.sh
sudo ./elementary-post-install.sh
```
